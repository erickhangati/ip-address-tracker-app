# Frontend Mentor - IP Address Tracker App

![Design preview for the IP address tracker coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a challenge from Frontend Mentor. We were supposed to build an IP Address Tracker App.

## How it works

On page load, the app gets IP details by the help of browser location API which is used to get data using a GeoLocation API.

The details are deplayed and a map loaded with user current location from Leaflet Map API.

There is also an IP search input form where we can search IP details.

## Technologies Used

1. HTML
2. CSS (Grid, Flexbox, SASS)
3. React JS
4. APIs (Gealocation & Leaflet Maps)
